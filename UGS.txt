( Adhesion Test G-code Program - Single Sample with Delay )
G21         ; Set units to millimeters
G90         ; Use absolute positioning
(--- Start of Program ---)
( Start at safety height Z = -1mm at X = 0mm )
G0 X0 Z-1       ; Rapid move to starting position at safety height
(--- Testing Single Sample in Positive X-Direction ---)
( Move Z to contact marble )
G1 Z0.05 F100      ; Move Z-axis up 1.05mm to Z = 0.025mm to make contact
G1 X0.5 F50           ; Move X-axis +1mm while maintaining contact
G1 Z-1 F100         ; Retract Z-axis back to safety height
(--- Testing Single Sample in Negative X-Direction ---)
( Move Z to contact marble )
G1 Z0.05 F100      ; Move Z-axis up to make contact
G1 X0 F50          ; Move X-axis -1mm while maintaining contact
G1 Z-1 F100         ; Retract Z-axis back to safety height
(--- Preload Testing: Up and Down in Z-Direction ---)
( Move Z to contact marble )
G1 Z0.05 F100      ; Move Z-axis up to make contact
G4 P1            ; Delay for 1 second (P value is in seconds)
